# Sun-Protection-Factor

As a skincare enthusiast, I have always wondered how the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) functioned in terms of length and efficacy against UV light. This program, with a modifiable tester file, can determine the duration of sunscreen and efficacy against UVB rays using two inputs: the SPF number and typical burn time of the user. Studies show that SPF efficacy against UVB rays actually functions on a logarithmic scale, highlighting how even low SPF can provide benefits against sun damage.
